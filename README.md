# Applied-Black-Litterman-on-Swiss-portfolios
Quantitative Risk Management Project

<h1>Introduction</h1>

Departing from the CAPMâ€™s strong assumption of the homogeneity of expectations of risk
and returns, particular views of a manager can be implemented into the asset allocation, using
the Black-Litterman model (BL) in order to potentially generate alpha, outperformance over
the benchmark. After a brief review of this model and its assumptions, a basic implementation
on Swiss equities will be given. Then, the COP approach will be presented and a succinct
example on the yield curve will be provided. The underlying question of the project will be to
know if our views indeed help to achieve a better allocation under this particular model. In
conclusion, we will review the results, discuss new trends in finance and emphasize why using
the above-mentioned approach is relevant nowadays.
